<p>Introduction of the mini-project, Example #4:</p>
<p>This example addresses a number up issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, it circumvents the issue identifed in Example #3 which is the need to have up to date data. The data are now retrieved from the NASA.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, would like to further test mixing R and Python code. The work could be done in either language but yet, the ability to mix the best of both languages is desirable in some circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, it interesting to look at the data on global warming. Of course, this is one of the most important challenges that humanity faces, if not the most important.</p></li>

<p>Like the previous plot but now the data are truncated by a minimum year to plot in order to give a better resolution. The line plotting function joins the points with the spline function which is a bit more appealing i think. Color coding is the same as in the “Line Plot” i.e.&nbsp;only colored by year. The steady progress of climate change is astonishing, and sadly, 2023 seems to represent some kind of accelerated change as it really stands out from the pack of already disturbing anomaly curves.</p>

# Data Fetch

## Row {height="40%"}

Introduction of the mini-project, Example #4:

This example addresses a number up issues.

-   Firstly, it circumvents the issue identifed in Example #3 which is the need to have up to date data. The data are now
retrieved from the NASA.

-   Secondly, would like to further test mixing R and Python code. The work could be done in either language but yet, the ability
to mix the best of both languages is desirable in some circumstances.

-   And finally, it interesting to look at the data on global warming. Of course, this is one of the most important challenges
that humanity faces, if not the most important.

# Line Plot

## Row {height="10%"}

The line plot shows all the available data. An approximately linear increase in temparature anomoly can be seen from around 1978.

## Row {height="90%"}

```{python}
#| title: Line Plot

# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime64
dfml['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(dfml['Date'])

# for use in another mini-project 
dfml.to_csv("../Dash/gistemp.csv",index=False)

```

```{python}
#| title: Line Plot

fig = px.line(
  dfml, x="Date", y="Anomoly_Celcius"
  )

# Set x-axis Date range
start_date = '1880-01-01'
end_date = '2030-01-01'
fig.update_xaxes(range=[start_date, end_date])
    
```

# Violin Plot

## Row {height="15%"}

A violin plot of all the available data. Each 'violin' is a summary of data points for each of the 12 month for that given year.
The 'violin' encompasses a box-plot if one Zooms in. Zooming and other dynamic plotting features require a manual refresh after
using the controls.

The variability of anomolies can be seen clearly with some years have low variability e.g. 1971 and some high e.g. 2023.

## Row {height="85%"}

```{python}
#| title: Violin plot of all available data.
fig = px.violin(dfml, y="Anomoly_Celcius", x="Year", box=True, 
  hover_data=[dfml.Anomoly_Celcius, dfml.Year, dfml.month] )
fig.show()
```

# Violin Since..

## Row {height="5%"}

```{python}
year_var = 1960
print("Violin Plot Since", year_var)

```

## Row {height="5%"}

A violin plot of data limited to a minimum year. The violins are accompanied by data points dots to the left for each month.

## Row {height="90%"}

```{python}
#| title: Violin Plot Since..

dfml_short = dfml[dfml['Year'] &gt;= year_var]

fig = px.violin(dfml_short, 
  y="Anomoly_Celcius", x="Year", box=False, 
  points="all", 
  hover_data=[dfml_short.Anomoly_Celcius, dfml_short.Year, dfml_short.month])
fig.show()
```

# Line by Year

## Row {height="15%"}

-   This plot I find remarkable: the line colour is a gradient from green through orange to red and is only assigned by the year
(i.e. the temperature anomoly is not considered in choosing the color).

-   The colored banding pattern correlates quite well with temperature anomalies. Sadly, there is no doubt that climate change is
progressing year by year and this plot illustrates the phenomena quite well.

## Row {height="85%"}

```{python}
#| title: Line by Year

# very strange that line_shape='spline' results in an error here
# but with the almost identical code below it's not a problem 

# Specify the desired length of the color array as 
# the number of distinct years
# Generate the color array
colors = get_color_array(dfml['Year'].nunique())

fig1 = px.line(dfml, 
  y="Anomoly_Celcius", x="Month_Number",
  line_group="Year", line_shape='hvh',
  markers=True,
  color='Year', 
  color_discrete_sequence=colors,
  hover_data=[dfml.Anomoly_Celcius, dfml.Year, dfml.month]
  )
  
  
# Set the x-axis resolution to label every month
# Strangely these arguments do not work when generating the initial plot
fig1.update_layout(xaxis=dict(
        tickmode='linear',  # Use linear tick mode
        dtick=1  # Specify the interval between ticks
    ))  

```

# Line by Year Since..

Like the previous plot but now the data are truncated by a minimum year to plot in order to give a better resolution. The line
plotting function joins the points with the spline function which is a bit more appealing i think. Color coding is the same as in
the "Line Plot" i.e. only colored by year. The steady progress of climate change is astonishing, and sadly, 2023 seems to
represent some kind of accelerated change as it really stands out from the pack of already disturbing anomaly curves.

# Always more to do..

The main task target of exploring Dashboards with R and Python mash-up is completed. However, there are really many ways of
representing, analyzing and processing this data.

Some targets, given time, include:

(1) plots of yearly averaged data (simple correlations, heat-maps..)
(2) statistical hypothesis testing
(3) regression analysis and prediction
(4) more dynamic interaction features
(5) small restructing for robustness: locally cache the read of the source data and operate on the latest version of valid data in
the case of server or network down conditions
(6) data source change trigger
(7) and surely, more points to add......
